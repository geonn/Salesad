# Remote Image Widget [![Titanium](http://www-static.appcelerator.com/badges/titanium-git-badge-sq.png)](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/) [![Alloy](http://www-static.appcelerator.com/badges/alloy-git-badge-sq.png)](http://www.appcelerator.com/alloy/)

This widget for the [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com) Titanium Alloy MVC framework provides a view that supports remote image loading with full image caching. Image caching is made using a fork of [TiCachedImages](https://github.com/sukima/TiCachedImages).

## Installing
### Get it [![gitTio](http://gitt.io/badge.png)](http://gitt.io/component/com.baboonmedia.remoteimage)
Download this repository and consult the [Alloy Documentation](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Alloy_XML_Markup-section-35621528_AlloyXMLMarkup-ImportingWidgets) on how to install it, or simply use the [gitTio CLI](http://gitt.io/cli):

`$ gittio install com.baboonmedia.remoteimage`

## Usage

Just require the widget on a view:

```xml
<Widget src="com.baboonmedia.remoteimage" id="RemoteImage">
	<ActivityIndicator id="activityIndicator" role="activityindicator" />
    <View role="loadingerror">
       <Label>Unable to load image. Tap to retry</Label>
    </View>
</Widget>
```

### Child Views

Inside the widget you can assign a couple of child views with `role` assigned to display the activity indicator and an error message.

- `loadingerror` - The view with this `role` will be shown when there was an error loading the remote image with a `singletap` listener attached to it to retry laoding of the image.
- `activityindicator` - The activity indicator to be shown while loading the image. It can be any kind of view as long as it has a `show()`and `hide()`method.

## Widget Specific Properties

Besides the common Titanium properties of a view, the widget accepts the following properties to determine it's behavior.

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| image | String | Full url of the image to load. |
| autoload | Boolean | If set to `false` the image won't be loaded until the `load` method is called. |
| gethires | Boolean |  If this property is set to `true` then the url will be parsed to include the @2x suffix. For example, if url is set to http://mysite.com/image.jpg and `gethires` is set to `true`, then the url will be converted to http://mysite.com/image@2x.jpg. |
| onDone | Function | Function to be called when the image has been loaded. The callback will be sent a `msg` string with the full details of the cached file. |
| onError | Function | Function to be called if the image has failed loading. The callback will be sent an `error` string with the error message. |

## Run-time styling

You can use `$.myId.applyProperties()` to apply any new properties to the widget after it has been automatically initialized:

```javascript
$.myId.applyProperties({
	autoload: true,
    image: 'http://mysite.com/otherimage.jpg',
    backgroundColor: 'black'
});
```

## Public Methods

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| applyProperties() | Method to assign new properties to the widget |
| load() | If the image hasn't been loaded start loading the image. This method has to be called manually if `autoload` is set to `false` |
| setImage() | Sets a new image and loads it if `autoload` is set to `true` |
| getImage() | Returns the url of the current image |
| getImageCachePath() | Returns the local path of the cached image |
| clean() | It's highly recommended that you call this method before disposing from the object to prevent memory leaks. |
| gc() | Calls the garbage collector to clean any expired images. Upon initialization the garbage collector is called. |
| wipeCache() | Clear everything on the cache, regardless if it has expired or not. |

## Configuration

To set configuration set them in your `app/config.json`.

You can adjust the following variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| remoteimage_timeout | 120000 | Sets the `http` timeout. |
| remoteimage_property_key | RemoteImage |  The `Ti.App.Property` key to use for storing the cache metadata. |
| remoteimage_directory | RemoteImageCache | The directory to save the cache files. The `applicationDataDirectory` is prefixed. |
| remoteimage_expiration | 8640000 | How long in miliseconds a cached file is considered expired since the last time it was requested. |
| remoteimage_requests | 20 | The number of simultaneous network requests allowed. |
| remoteimage_debug | 0 | Set to `1` to display debug messages. |

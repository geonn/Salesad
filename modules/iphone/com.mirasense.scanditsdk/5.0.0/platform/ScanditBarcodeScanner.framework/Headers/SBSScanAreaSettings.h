/**
 * \brief Scanning area settings control where codes are to be searched in images/frames.
 *
 * The areas as well as the hot-spot is specified in relative coordinates. The coordinates are rotated
 * with the device: The top-left corner of the camera preview is 0,0, whereas 1,1 is the bottom-right
 * corner. Coordinates specified outside of the supported range raise an exception.
 *
 * For most use-cases, the "active scanning area portrait/active scanning area landscape" available as
 * part of the \ref SBSScanSettings is sufficient and is simpler to use. We only recommend to use the
 * \ref SBSScanAreaSettings if you have very specific needs for your application that can't be met 
 * with the "active scanning area" interface.
 *
 * This class allows to control the areas separately for wide and square symbologies. Classification
 * of symbologies into square and wide is according to their aspect ratio: symbologies that have a
 * width/height ratio different from one (1d codes, PDF417, etc.) are classified as wide, symbologies 
 * whose width/height aspect ratio is close to 1.0 (QR, Aztec etc.) are classified as square. 
 * Symbologies whose aspect ratio can vary, e.g. DataMatrix, or DataBar, are classified according to 
 * their pre-dominant aspect ratio.
 *
 * \note This interface is not part of the stable API yet and is subject to change. Functionality 
 *      may dissappear, or change in future releases.
 * \since 5.0
